# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Week 9 - Date: March 14, 2025
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
10 

### Rose:
Developed the core functionality of the R Shiny app and established basic player interactions with a histogram.


### Bud: 
Shapiro-Wilks test is working but mentor requested a 1-sample T-test instead. 

### Thorn: 
Trouble integrating the physics engine. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

### Week 10 - Date: March 21, 2025
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
10 

### Rose:
We transitioned from the concept-driven interface to a more physics-based experience by implementing Box2DWeb in appi2.R. This marked a major advancement in the gameâ€™s feel and realism.


### Bud: 
Still trying to have the game register a 1-sample T-test.

### Thorn: 
Need to come up with an engaging scoring system. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

### Week 11 - Date: March 28, 2025
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
10 

### Rose:
Refined our physics integration and improved UI responsiveness. In appi3.R, we enhanced the rendering logic, brick behavior, and brick removal mechanics using Box2DWeb to make the game more stable and intuitive for users.
Optimized the random histogram generator to create a wider variety of distributions, including clearly non-normal ones like U-shaped and multimodal patterns.

### Bud: 
If possible, move to a different physics engine and platform. One that is even more engaging to the player.

### Thorn: 
Still need to come up with an engaging scoring system.
